**Project Title:**
List of the Most Absurd Reasons To Cry

**Project Overview:**
This app is designed to allow users to share and interact with the funniest or most absurd reasons they've cried. It’s a community-driven platform where users can submit their stories, vote on others' submissions, and enjoy a dynamic, personalized experience based on their interactions. Users will be able to register and log in, manage their submissions, upvote or downvote content, and interact with others in a fun, engaging way.

**Key Features:**
User Authentication:

Registration: New users can create an account using their email and password, which allows them to participate in the app.
Session Management: Once logged in, users will have a personalized session using tokens (likely using JWT - JSON Web Tokens) to manage their active sessions securely. This ensures that users don’t need to log in repeatedly while using the app.
Login: Users can log into their accounts and start submitting their own reasons or vote on others' submissions.
Security: The authentication process ensures that only registered users can interact with certain features, such as submitting reasons and voting.
Personalized Experience:

The app dynamically adjusts the content shown to the user based on their interaction with the app.
For example, if a user consistently votes for humorous reasons, the app will show more of those types of submissions in the future.
Personalization algorithms can be used to adjust content in real-time, making each user's experience unique.
Voting and Ranking System:

Users can vote on the absurd reasons submitted by others, either by upvoting or downvoting.
Submissions will be ranked based on the number of votes they receive, and users will see top-ranked reasons in the list.
The voting system helps to highlight the funniest or most absurd stories based on community input.
CRUD Operations for Reason:

Create: Users can submit new reasons they’ve cried (add a new story).
Read: Users can view submitted reasons from others.
Update: Users can edit their submitted reasons if they want to improve or modify their submission.
Delete: Users can delete their own submissions if they no longer wish to keep them in the system.
Dynamic User-Generated Content:

All the content in the app is generated by users. This creates a constantly evolving list of absurd reasons to cry, with new stories and interactions coming from the community.
The content is dynamic because it is based on user submissions, which keeps the platform fresh and engaging.
User Interaction & Engagement:

Users can comment on reasons submitted by others, fostering conversation and interaction.
There will likely be additional features to encourage engagement, such as liking or sharing reasons on social media.
Users will also be able to follow other users to keep track of their submissions and votes.
Search and Filter Options:

Users will be able to search for specific keywords or filter reasons based on certain categories (e.g., “funny,” “embarrassing,” “heartfelt”).
This makes it easier for users to find specific reasons that align with their interests.
Notifications (Optional):

Users can receive notifications about new content, replies to their submissions, or when someone votes on their reason.
These notifications can encourage users to return to the app and stay engaged with the content.
Admin Panel:

The admin panel will allow administrators to manage user accounts, moderate content, and manage the overall flow of the platform.
Admins can approve, edit, or delete inappropriate submissions and ensure the app remains fun and safe.
Social Sharing:

Users can share their favorite reasons to cry on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
This feature encourages virality and helps attract new users to the platform by sharing funny and absurd content.
